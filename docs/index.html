        <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
        <p>
            The Ambulance Call Service in India redirects the call to the hospital based on the distance between the patient and
            and the hospital. Whichever hospital is nearest, It will redirect the call to that hospital. For e.g. If a patient calls from location <em>L</em> and there is two hospitals nearby one is 
            <em>H<sub>A</sub></em> & <em>H<sub>B</sub></em>. It takes 5 minutes to reach <em>H<sub>A</sub></em> and 10 minutes
            to reach <em>H<sub>B</sub></em> from location <em>L</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suppose, there is traffic jam between location <em>L</em> and hospital <em>H<sub>A</sub></em> which in turn increases
            the travel time to 20 minutes. Now, the hospital with feasible travel time is <em>H<sub>B</sub></em> because the travel time is 10 minutes.
            But, the current system will still redirect the call to <em>H<sub>A</sub></em> because it considers only the distance not the travel time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another problem is, in congested areas, the patient has to guide the ambulance. Also, If someone met with an accident 
            on a highway. It is very hard to find the precise location of the patient.
        </p>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
            I will create a webapp which figures out all the nearest hospital, and return the details of the hospital with feasible travel time(live).
            After that my app will send a message to the patient and that message will contain a link. As soon as the patient clicks the link, it will automatically send
            the precise location of the patient even the geographical coordinates to my app. My app will send this information to the ambulance which will help the ambulance 
            to reach to the patient.
